-- LEFT JOIN (RIGHT JOIN is equivalent but not used)
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN is shortened to LEFT JOIN
-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN is shortened to RIGHT JOIN


-- FROM left_table
-- LEFT JOIN right_table
-- N.B. FROM clause is considered the left table,
-- so all data from left_table is included

-- effectively inner join with extra data

-- FULL OUTER JOIN shortened to OUTER JOIN

-- N.B. using AND clause for condition after ON clause will 'pre-filter'
